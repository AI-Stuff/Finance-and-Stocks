    "### Raising money for a startup\n",
    "- 5 friends have an idea and decide to form a company\n",
    "- Initially they form the company and issue 1M shares\n",
    "- If we make the balance sheet , assets will be the Idea, unique strenght that each guy brings on the table. They dont get a loan to start their business as banks denied giving loan to them so they dont have any liability\n",
    "- Since they have 1M shares issued so each of them gets 200K shares or in other word 20% of the shares\n",
    "- To set up the business they need money. They approach [angel investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/angelinvestor.asp) and one of them agrees to fund them.\n",
    "- Here they agree on a pre money evalution of 5M, which means that both the angel investors and the 5 friends agree to value their assets(which is primarily only their Idea at this point of time) at 5M\n",
    "- The angel investor agrees to give them 5M dollars. This means he will supply 5M cash and the asset value will become 10M and he takes 50% of the shares\n",
    "- __pre money valuation + funding = post money valuation__\n",
    "- 50% shares is given to the investors by issuing 1M new shares.so there is a total of 2M shares now. This means each of the friend's share got diluted to 10% which was earlier 20%\n",
    "- We can see it this way, earlier they owned 20% of 5M which is 1M now they own 10% of 10M which is also 1M. Hence their value is essentially the same\n",
