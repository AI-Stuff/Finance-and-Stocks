    "## What is a Bond\n",
    "- Its a way by which someone can lend money to the company. A bond holder is a partial lender to the company\n",
    "- Lets say a company needs 500K and its share price is \\\\&100. So it can issue 5K shares and raise the required 500K or it can issue bonds.\n",
    "- Those who buy the bonds don't become equity holders but they become lenders to the comapny. Thus they earn interest from it\n",
    "- Inspite of the company performing good or bad, bond holders wont get the cut of the profit instead they will get paid before the equity holders get any profit.\n",
    "- Suppose a company issues bonds of _face value_ 1000\\\\$, and 10% annual _coupon_, _maturity_ of 2years\n",
    "- It means any one who buys that bond pays 1000\\\\$ for it. He gets 100\\\\$ annually for 2 years before getting back his 1000\\\\$\n",
    "- The interest is generally given semi-annually, so the bond holder will get 50\\\\$ every 6 months and on 24th month he will get this interest as well as the 1000\\\\$ back.\n"

    "## Corporate bond vs Traditional mortgages\n",
    "- Suppose someone takes a 1M mortage, then the bank will figure out a fixed amount payable at a regular interval say a month, this payment will not change during the term or the lifetime of the mortgage.\n",
    "- In this payment some part of it is used to pay the interest and some part is paying the principle\n",
    "- Early on during the paymnent life, most of the payment is interest and some part of it is goes to pay the principle\n",
    "- As the payment amount and interest rate is fixed, so the consequent fixed payments will pay off more principle and less interest as more and more debt is being paid.\n",
    "- Gradually with the last payment, very little of it will be the interest and most of it will be principle. After this payment loan would be paid off.\n",
    "\n",
    "![debt](Resources/debt.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "- But corporate debt is interest only debt, this means every fixed payment is interest only\n",
    "- At the end of the term of the loan the fixed payment will be paid as interest as usual and also the entire principle needs to be paid at once\n",
    "- Most of the companies would not have that much cash to pay the entire principle at once. So they take another loan of the same principle amount (from same or different bank at same or different interest rate) and use it to pay the old loan.\n",
    "- And the company continues to pay the interest for this new loan."

    "## Introduction to yield curve\n",
    "- Treasury bills, Treasury notes and treasury bonds are all loans to the central government. These are considered very safe and risk free as governments can always pay off its loan by increasing its taxes\n",
    "- These treasury securities are basically [IOUs](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/IOU.html) saying that the government will return the money in the designated time with interest. For T-Bills time is 1month to 1year, T-Notes time is 1year to 10years, T-Bonds time is beyond 10 years\n",
    "- Generally if someone say A lends money to B for a month and to C for 1 year, there is a less associated in 1 month than a year. So A would charge less interest to B than C or in other terms B would want his interest to be less than C.\n",
    "- Similarly when government needs money they issue these treasury securities.\n",
    "- When the government issues these securities, it performes an auction and based on the demand of these securities the interest  rates are decided. If the demand is more, interest is less and vice-versa.\n",
    "- In general more people will be willing to lend money to the government for a shorter period of time as the risk is less, hence demand for a shorter time period security will be more and thus governemnt will choose to pay less interest rate for them.\n",
    "- Government does auctions for all of the different durations. For T-bond as the risk is high less people will be willing to buy it so the government will be forced to give higher interest rate for them. Thus the [yield curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldcurve.asp) is upward sloping.\n",
