    "## Corporate bond vs Traditional mortgages\n",
    "- Suppose someone takes a 1M mortage, then the bank will figure out a fixed amount payable at a regular interval say a month, this payment will not change during the term or the lifetime of the mortgage.\n",
    "- In this payment some part of it is used to pay the interest and some part is paying the principle\n",
    "- Early on during the paymnent life, most of the payment is interest and some part of it is goes to pay the principle\n",
    "- As the payment amount and interest rate is fixed, so the consequent fixed payments will pay off more principle and less interest as more and more debt is being paid.\n",
    "- Gradually with the last payment, very little of it will be the interest and most of it will be principle. After this payment loan would be paid off.\n",

    "- But corporate debt is interest only debt, this means every fixed payment is interest only\n",
    "- At the end of the term of the loan the fixed payment will be paid as interest as usual and also the entire principle needs to be paid at once\n",
    "- Most of the companies would not have that much cash to pay the entire principle at once. So they take another loan of the same principle amount (from same or different bank at same or different interest rate) and use it to pay the old loan.\n",
    "- And the company continues to pay the interet for this new loan."
