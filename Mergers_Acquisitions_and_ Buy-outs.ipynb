    "## Acquisitions\n",
    "- Lets say company A wants to buy company B at 60M \\\\$ using its shares.\n",
    "- Current trading price for A'share is 30\\\\$\n",
    "- So A can issue 2M shares sell them into the market with a secondary offering and hopefully generate 60M cash to buy company B\n",
    "- But this a share offering,so the transactiion will be in shares and not cash.\n",
    "- Lets say company B has 1M shares trading at 50\\\\$ per share. So its market cap is 50M\\\\$\n",
    "- So company A will give its 2M shares to all of the shareholders of company B in return of all of the existing shares of company B.\n",
    "- It will be done by giving 2 shares of company A in return of 1 share of company B.\n",
    "- So basically every shareholder of company B will get 60\\\\$ worth of A's share in return of 50\\\\$ worth of B's share. It is a 20% return and hence they will agree readily.\n",

    "#### Price Behaviour after acquisition announcement\n",
    "- Lets study the price behaviour once the announcement or press release is made regaring the acquisition\n",
    "- If the company A's shares closing price was 35\\\\$. Every shareholder of B will get \\\\$70 in the transaction\n",
    "- If A's share price goes to \\\\$25. every shareholder of B will get \\\\$50\n",
    "- Lets say A's share price is \\\\$30 after announcement is made. So this should affect the trading price of B's share as well. B's share price should jump to \\\\$60 (i.e double of A's price) immediately.\n",
    "- If this jump doesn't happen i.e B is not trading at double the price of A, then people will rush to buy B's share as 1 share of B  is worth 2 shares of A.\n",
    "- So ideally once the announcement is made B's trading price should rise and get doubled of A's trading price. "
