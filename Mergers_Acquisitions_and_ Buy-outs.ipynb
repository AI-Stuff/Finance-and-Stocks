    "- Lets say company A wants to buy company B at 60M \\\\$ using its shares.\n",
    "- Current trading price for A'share is 30\\\\$\n",
    "- So A can issue 2M shares sell them into the market with a secondary offering and hopefully generate 60M cash to buy company B\n",
    "- But this a share offering,so the transactiion will be in shares and not cash.\n",
    "- Lets say company B has 1M shares trading at 50\\\\$ per share. So its market cap is 50M\\\\$\n",
    "- So company A will give its 2M shares to all of the shareholders of company B in return of all of the existing shares of company B.\n",
    "- It will be done by giving 2 shares of company A in return of 1 share of company B.\n",
    "- So basically every shareholder of company B will get 60\\\\$ worth of A's share in return of 50\\\\$ worth of B's share. It is a 20% return and hence they will agree readily."
